	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="step">
    	<h3>What data leaves the user's machine?</h3>
    		<p>ALL inputs into forms within this website remain COMPLETELY client-side never reaching our servers. The user's machine, facilitated with Javascript, processes all information. The only data passing through and being logged by our servers is the page requests, in an anonymous manner.</p>
    	<h3>I'm interested in using this program in a hospital environment. What do I need to do to use this program?</h3>
    		<p>Feel free to use this program for whatever purposes unofficially. However, please be aware of our <a href="http://myinsul.in/disclaimer/">disclaimer</a>. If you're interested in becoming officially associated with this program, send us an email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@myinsul.in">webmaster@myinsul.in</a>.</p>

	<h2>About The Project</h2>
    <div class="step">
      	<h3>Commitment</h3>
      		<p>This is more than a science fair project. It will require, as what we hope, years of maintenance to keep running smoothly and up-to-date. We fully understand the size of this project we are taking on, absolutely ready to go the extra mile to make sure it stays maintained for as long as wanted!</p>
      	<h3>Stability</h3>
      		<p>As of the first of December 2011, we will be releasing out of development into a stable release. As of that date, we will be sure to release updates ONLY after a full review to check for any bugs created, as well as updating a roadmap with the changes made for your convenience. We realize that, within a hospital setting, stability is #1.</p>
	
	<h2>The Staff</h2>
	<div class="step">
		<h3>Annelise R. Cummings</h3>
      		<p>The team leader of this project, Cummings is a 17 year old senior at <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/schools/cleveland/">Cleveland High School</a>. During initial development of MyInsul.in, Cummings was involved in the data collection and statistical analysis of the success of the tool. In 2012 she began programing components on the website remaining an organized lead on the project (keeping Alex on task even when he's in college).</p>
      	<h3>Alexander Eskil Harding</h3>
      		<p>Harding is a 18 year old freshman at <a href="http://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. Currently majoring in computer engineering and computer science, Harding remains the technological whiz of the project leading development of the full-sized and mobile websites. He is currently working part time at the <a href="trace.wisc.edu">Trace Center</a> and began heading his own department (Research to Reality) in February, a project designed to create products to increase the accessibility of tools to people with disabilities.</p>
		<h3>Dr. Paul J. Cummings</h3>
			<p>Dr. Cummings was the supervising scientist during the beginning phases of MyInsul.in. Dr. Cummings worked with the students to developed components physicians like himself needed at Legacy Health Systems. Currently, Dr. Cummings is a strong advocate for this program and is pushing for further development of the tool including further integration of MyInsul.in at Legacy Health Systems.</p>

    <h2>History of MyInsul.in</h2>
    <div class="step">
    	<h3>Before MyInsul.in</h3>
			<p>Before embarking on MyInsul.in, Cummings and Harding met in Middle School and began to get to know each other to the point of becoming best friends. Both Harding and Cummings have been competing at science fairs since middle school and began working together on a team their freshman year of high school. As freshmen at <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/schools/cleveland/">Cleveland High School</a>, they, along with Mariah Bruns, worked on the project <a href="http://www.askpeat.org/firstyear/">Ask PEAT</a>, determining if online music videos are safe for teens with photosensitive epilepsy. Ask PEAT won 1st in Medicine at <a href="http://www.nwse.org/">NWSE</a> after winning best of fair at <a href="http://www.nwse.org/ppsse">PPSSE</a> which qualified them for <a href="http://www.societyforscience.org/isef/">Intel ISEF 2010</a> in San Jose. Harding and Cummings proceeded to attend ISEF for the following two years.</p>
			<p>Harding continued working on Ask PEAT the following year attempting to create an open source tool which analyzed videos for flashing lights that could potentially cause seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/vifitool/">VIFIT</a>. Annie changed into looking at music analysis and narcissism in "It's Not All about Me: An Investigation of Psychological Processes in Popular Songs". Both projects qualified for Intel ISEF.</p>
		<h3>MyInsul.in 2011-2012</h3>
      		<p>In October of 2011, Alexander Harding and Annelise Cummings began creating MyInsul.in for Legacy Hospital Systems to allow the physicians to have access to a tool that allowed them to quickly and accurately prescribe a Basal-Bolus regimen on the hospital floor. Their research won them the opportunity to attend the Intel ISEF 2012 and has begun a conversation at the hospital on patient safety.
			<p>More information can be found on the <a href="http://myinsul.in/googlesci">website</a> describing the project.</p>
		<h3>The Future of MyInsul.in</h3>
			<p>Following the initial development, Cummings and Harding began to move their separate ways, remaining friends along the way. In January 2013, Dr. Cummings proposed to the pair a continuation project for further development of the tool. As Harding was starting to head up his own project at his work, Cummings began embarking on the proposed project.</p>
			<p>Cummings is developing a Glucommander to provide nurses and surgeons with a tool that allows them to calculate an IV insulin regimen for their patients. This advancement will require an overhaul of the program resulting in new formatting and organization of pages. To ensure a steady transition from the current version of MyInsul.in to the new version, an user guide and accompanying instructional video will be created and linked to increase the education and accessibility of the tool in the hospital.</p>
			<p>The current goal is to have a working version of in late March early April so stay tuned for more updates.</p>
